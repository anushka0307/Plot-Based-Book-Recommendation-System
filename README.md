# Plot-Based Book Recommendation System

**Ever finished a book and desperately wished you could find another just like it? The one with the twists that kept you guessing, the moments that made you laugh out loud, or the characters that stole your heart? We all have!**

This project intends to help ardent readers by throwing away the boring recommendations and diving deeper! It's a system that analyses the heart of a story – the plot, the characters, the emotions – to find books that echo the elements you love. Think of it like a literary matchmaker, connecting you with your next great read. 

_So, ditch the "been-there-done-that" suggestions and discover hidden gems that resonate with the stories that hold a special place on your bookshelf!!_


> This project gives a step-by-step explanation of how a book-recommendation-system is implemented. At the end of each step, the output is shown to demonstrate what has been done so far. 

This project is your guide to learning the basics of NTLK and scikitLearn in python!
